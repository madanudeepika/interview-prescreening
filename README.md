# interview-exercises

This is a collection of exercises used for our javascript interview process.

## Note

You will notice that there a several directories, some prefixed with UI and others PS. These prefixes represent two types of exercises. One User Interface and the other is Problem Solving. Each directory includes a README with the instructions for that exercise.
 
## Instructions

1) Clone git repo as you will be uploading you work to your own repo later.
2) Select one UI exercise and one PS exercises you would like to work.
3) Review the instructions for each exercise in that directory's README.
4) Commit all your work into the applicable directories and push your work to any web-based git platform such as Github or Bitbucket.
5) Send in the link to your finished repo for review.

## Rules

- For UI exercises you may use any UI framework you choose or none at all if that is your style.
- For PS exercises you should not use any libraries just vanilla JS.
- All completed exercise files should reside in the applicable exercise's directory.
- Add comments to each exercise README describing how to run you code.
- Have fun!
